# Shortest-Vector-Problem

This was my system programming summative, which attempted to tackle the shortest vector problem (SVP) through a variety of
advanced optimisation techniques. My report, which is in this directory, details and explains all these techniques.

To run this yourself, do the following:
- Ensure you have g++ and make installed
- Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it
- Download main.cpp and Makefile to this project directory
- Open a terminal and navigate to this directory
- run "make"
- run ./runme "[1.0 0.0 0.0]" "[0.0 1.0 0.0]" "[0.0 0.0 1.0]"
-   or any other vector you want to test, in any dimension you wan to test
